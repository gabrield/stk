STK - Small toolkit based on Xlib;

To compile, type ''make'' (without the quotes) on your terminal and voil√†!
STK's goal is to provide a small widget set for small applications.

Widget list:

* Window
* Button
* Text Area (for input and output text, useful, but still need some changes)
* Canvas (for drawing curves, lines and other geometric objects, under development :D)
* ProgressBar (under test, seems to work fine, but nobody knows :p)
* Listbox (planned) 

Take a look at test.c to see the basics of STK;
